# SoK: Where’s the “up”?! A Comprehensive (bottom-up) Study on the Security of Arm Cortex-M Systems

This repository contains four components for researching and understanding Cortex-M microcontrollers:

1. The Cortex-M firmware analysis tool and firmware database (in `firmware_analysis` folder)
2. Cortex-M hardware feature test suits (in `hw_feature_test_suites` folder)
3. An interactive figure showcasing the relationships between Cortex-M limitations, issues, and mitigations (download `relations_interactive_fig.html`)
4. [The Google Sheet link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWaPkYhWN8H_5XIA9zWZErhj2j2HMoxlJKs5AMwcE5c/edit?usp=sharing) to a collection of Cortex-M-related CVEs
